## Early design of settings command

In a very early version of askers version 1.0.0, instead of using buttons to change current settings, you were instead required to go into certain category to manage them. The idea was scrapped with the final beta build of 1.0.0.

The embed color was also changed from green to yellow in the final beta build as well.

## 1.0.1

Askers version 1.0.1 is a cancelled build of Askers for aoi.js v5. It was the version where it's supposed to have the languages feature but due to v5 being breaking by discord api changes, 1.0.1 was cancelled and it was replaced by 1.0.2 to provide support for aoi.js v6 (alongside with the language feature).

## The akinator command
Askers experience used to be smooth until one day, all of sudden the package api it uses has faced issues that it's now generally being slower and heavy on resouces to be used. As a result, the development just went paused until someday the creators figure out as this still happens to this very day.

One of these issues was that, the [Certificate](https://github.com/jgoralcz/aki-api/issues/143) somehow has been installed incorrectly causing the package to be unusable. Though, this was solved using the package `node_extra_ca_certs_mozilla_bundle` but however, this caused resources to be extremely heavy once you use the package with it which is why the experience of Akinator in Askers is no longer great.
