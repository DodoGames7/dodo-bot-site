There're multiple Release types of Dodo-Bot in order to put a specific version into it's dedicated type of updates! This ranges from stable to dev!

# Types of updates
* Extended Support
* Dev
* Beta
* RC
* Stable

# Stable
The most common version that i offer. It's the main official version and it's recommended for public usages so it can be used on any bot you have access to! This version is recommended for new features and bug fixes.

# Extended Support
Versions that were in stable release get extended support into this part. It usually receives up to 8 ES updates or longer if the new version turned out to have problems than the previous. During this, they get bug fixes and changes backported from latest versions while avoiding touching the main parts of those that were changed in future releases.

# Dev
Commonly known in general as "development" versions that isn't ready to be marked as "Stable" simply. They have new changes and bug fixes but, however, they also get the latest bugs considering that they're unfinished and may have less finalized looks than compared to beta updates.

# Beta
Updates that are not ready but less buggy than development builds. It's suitable for public testing as it helps making the updates more stable so that there won't be any problems when it gets released as "Stable" update. It's still not recommended for public usages as the name says so...

# RC
Release Candidate. Versions in this state are finished but may need to look out for any bugs which still hasn't fixed into the bot. Unlike beta and dev, this version can be used for public usage with minimal risk but it's still not really recommended to do that unless you're aware of what you're doing.
