title: Release Types
---
There're multiple Release types of Dodo-Bot in order to put a specific version into it's dedicated type of updates! This ranges from Stable to RC!

## Types of updates
* Stable
* ES
* Pre-release
* Beta
* Preview

### Stable
The most common version that i offer. It's the main official version and it's recommended for public usages so it can be used on any bot you have access to! This version is recommended for new features and bug fixes.

### ES
Versions that were in stable release get extended support into this part. It usually receives up to 8 ES updates or longer if the new version turned out to have problems than the previous. During this, they get bug fixes and changes backported from latest versions while avoiding touching the main parts of those that were changed in future releases.

This release type has been discontinued in favour of new versions being released after a while.

### Pre-release
Commonly known as "GitBuilds" builds that isn't ready to be marked as "Stable" yet. They have new changes and bug fixes but, however, they also get the latest bugs considering that they're unfinished and may have less finalized looks compared to beta releases.

### Beta
Official builds that has been kind of stabilized for public testing. Versions in this state usually tend to only have minor bugs compared to "Pre-release" builds. This may make it look like it's stable and completed but, however, this is not true and using it in production is at your own risk.

It is highly recommended to test them for potential bugs.

### Preview
Versions in this state are basically a small Preview of what's to come. They may also either represent or not represent the final version of the works spent there.
