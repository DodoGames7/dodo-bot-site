## Which version should i use?
It depends on what do you prefer most of the time when it comes to trying open source discord bots from Github. I will try to make it simple:


## Stable
The main official version of Dodo-Bot. Usually comes with new features and a bunch of bug fixes from development later on. It is commonly used most of the time! As the name states, This is the recommended type of release for everyone due to obvious reasons.

### Use cases
You might need to use Stable in case of:
* You don't want to use a pre-release version of the bot
* You just want to setup the main version not caring about other types of versions
* Wanting the new features and improvements with bug fixes

## Beta
Versions that have finished the development stage. They usually encounter new features and changes but may still have bugs however. These are still not suitable for public usage due to the fact that it's still in "beta" and things may subject to change anytime soon.

### Use cases
You might need to use Beta in case of:
* Wanting to explore new features and on what's new in bot early
* Wanting to help stabilize the upcoming version before it reaches "Stable" release
* Don't mind living with bugs and you only want latest bug fixes before being released to stable releases

## Why are there build numbers in Pre-release builds?
Build numbers are used for easy identification of each build in cases where the new build has few changes and was similar to the previous one. It was introduced during the development of CupcakeX and has since then being used in other projects such as Dodo-Bot, etc. Usually, they start with a random number then that number changes each time a new build was being worked on. 

For instance, build 2066, a 2.1.0 build of Dodo-Bot was made with few changes then the build got jumped to 2070 due to the introduction of reworked stuff that were introduced there and the rest continues like that.


## Why do you use aoi.js as development primary focus? Shouldn't you switch to discord.js or even something much better?
Back in the day, i was BDFD user and i had trouble with focusing on my projects. It was overtime difficult to keep each project running in the hosting considering that my phone's battery runs out very quick and watching ads was tiring. Sadly, with all of this, the premium stopped me completely from continuing on and i decided to switch to aoi.js for less restrictions..

There were plans to switch to discord.js or something better but it was preferable imo to use smth similar to aoi.js as i wasn't ready to fully learn javascript to learn discord.js due to real life stuff. In the future, Dodo-Bot v3 may ditch aoi.js for something better but it's better off sticking to v2 for now as it's my last resort at creating a stable bot with fun experience.
