## Which version should i use?
It depends on what do you prefer most of the time when it comes to trying open source discord bots from Github. I will try to make it simple:


## Stable
The main official version of Dodo-Bot. Usually comes with new features and a bunch of bug fixes from development later on. It is commonly used most of the time as the name states. This is the recommended type of release for everyone due to obvious reasons.

## Use cases
You might need to use Stable in case of:
* You don't want to use a dev version of the bot
* You just want to setup the main version not caring about other types of versions
* Wanting the new features and improvements with bug fixes

### Es version
Also, known as "Extended support". Versions in this type typically get backports from latest version that mostly consists of minor changes and bug fixes. Those versions were created with the purpose of preparing to face obstacles in case most recent stable version turned out to have issues that did not occur during the development. Versions in this state last up to 8 ES updates where support would be officially cut and move to the next ES version.

## Use cases
You might need to use ES in case of:

* You expect the project to be highly stable and are paranoid of new stable versions that might have issues
* You don't care about new features and only want to get stable updates
* You aren't a fan of usually updating to next stable version
