description: Introduction to Developer panel of Dodo-Bot!
---

Developer panel is a way to manage certain things Dodo-Bot does behind the scenes. While it may seem like advanced panel for users who has access to a bot through Discord's dev portal, it is a pretty simple panel with certain options to modify depending on their needs.

# Welcome new Servers
This is a feature that let's Dodo-Bot send welcoming messages to the server it gets added into. It usually features brief summary about the project alongside with showing the users the bot's current default prefix for the server.

By default, it is enabled to avoid confusion for users who don't know the bot's prefix and to let them know that a instance of an Dodo-Bot is being used. It is possible to disable it by a single click through the `Toggle` button! Clicking the same aforementioned button will re-enable this feature.

# Error Logging
This feature let's users who has access to their bot setup a channel for logging the latest errors detected by Dodo-Bot through it's commands. This is useful for users willing to modify the instance of Dodo-Bot or when using the logs as a way to report bugs on the Github Issues page of the project. For Error logging to work, the feature must be enabled and have a existing channel setup for it as well in order to function!
